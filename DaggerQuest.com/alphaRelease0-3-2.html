				<h1>Updates:</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Made the tutorial items a little easier to pick up.</li>
					<li>Improved performance when generating shadows.</li>
					<li>Pressing any key will exit dialog with an NPC.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>Bug fixes:</h1>
				<p>Fixed the following issues:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Moved the player back to the correct starting location. (He'd been moved up by the windmill for
						testing, and we forgot to move him back before releasing <a
							href="alphaRelease0-3-1.html">0.3.1</a>. Oops.)
					</li>
					<li>The player would still deal damage with melee attacks if the player died in the middle of
						casting them.</li>
					<li>The player sometimes wouldn't finish their attack animation when using the basic attack.</li>
					<li>Shadows weren't appearing for some entities.</li>
					<li>The door to the cottage would sometimes disappear depending on the player's position.</li>
					<li>Enemies with ranged attacks would still sometimes generate their projectile even if they were
						stunned before it appeared.</li>
					<li>Applied all previous bug fixes related to the player's basic attack and abilities, to all
						abilities.</li>
					<li>The player wouldn't rotate to face the NPC they were talking too, if they were already within
						talking range.</li>
				</ul>
